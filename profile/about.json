    "about": " I am **Juyeon Hong**, avionics software engineer at Boeing Korea (BKETC), based in Seoul, South Korea. \n\n\nI'm also a music composer and a street photographer under my artist name, **Fox Romana**. As I love to explore the world and record all the inspiration I got from exotic experiences into my own music and photograph. You might feel the my raw, ungeneralized vibe from the audioization of my thoughts, and feelings for each target place. Please visit 'Projects' menu on top if you are interested in my recent works.",
